## ⚡ What This Adds to SE Assistant

Operational workflows and tooling built on top of the foundational SE Assistant rules:

- **Work Prioritization** - Smart dashboards for opportunities and launch cases
- **Post-Sales Support** - Launch case management with SE consultation tracking
- **Account Organization** - Structured folders for pre-sales, post-sales, and shared context
- **Personal Config** - Your Salesforce UserId, quarter dates, and preferences
- **Salesforce Integration** - Bidirectional sync with validation protocols
- **Team Collaboration** - GitHub-based structure that syncs to SE-NTRAL

**tl;dr:** Base SE Assistant = foundational rules. This repo = daily workflows + tooling + team collaboration.

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 0: Configure MCP Servers (REQUIRED)

**⚠️ Most important step** - Without MCPs, this tool won't work properly.

MCPs (Model Context Protocol servers) give the AI access to Shopify's internal tools. Think of them as API connectors.

**Setup guide:** [Shopify MCP Server Documentation](https://vault.shopify.io/ai/mcp_servers)

**Required MCPs:**
- ✅ **Revenue MCP** - Salesforce data, company enrichment, account info
- ✅ **Vault MCP** - Internal knowledge base, RFP responses, competitive battle cards
- ✅ **GWorkspace MCP** - Gmail threads, Drive docs, Calendar
- ✅ **Slack MCP** - Team conversations, merchant mentions

**Highly Recommended:**
- Scout MCP - Support tickets, merchant frustrations, sales conversations
- Shopify Dev MCP - API docs, GraphQL validation

**How to verify MCPs are working:**
```bash
@se-assistant "Get my Salesforce UserId"
```
If this returns your UserId, MCPs are configured correctly.

**Common MCP issues:**
- Need to re-authenticate with Google/Salesforce/Slack every few weeks
- Check Cursor settings → Features → Model Context Protocol
- Some MCPs require specific permissions (admin for Revenue MCP)

**Already have MCPs configured?** Skip to Step 1 below.

### Step 1: Clone & Setup

**First time setting up your work locally?**

1. Create an empty project folder
2. Open a terminal window at that folder
3. Run:
   ```bash
   git init
   git clone https://github.com/williambedard/SE-ASSISTANT_CONTEXT-HUB
   ```
4. Open the `SE-ASSISTANT_CONTEXT-HUB` folder in Cursor

**Already have the repo?** Just open it in Cursor and continue to Step 2.

---

### Step 2: Run Setup in Cursor

In Cursor, open the cloned folder and run:
```bash
@se-assistant "Set up SE-ASSISTANT_CONTEXT-HUB for me"
```
This creates your `personal-config.md` with your Salesforce UserId and quarter dates (gitignored).

---

### Step 3: Start Working

```bash
@se-assistant "New Opportunity: [Company Name]"
```

Done, prompt away! 🎉

## 🤖 What This Does Automatically

When you create a merchant folder, it pulls:
- ✅ Email threads from Gmail
- ✅ Slack conversations
- ✅ Google Drive docs
- ✅ Salesforce opportunity/launch case data
- ✅ Internal Shopify resources (Vault, Scout)
- ✅ Company research

All organized in your `merchants/[Company Name]/` folder with:
- `pre-sales/` - Briefing doc, discovery assessment, technical assessment
- `post-sales/` - Launch plan
- `raw-files/` - Emails, meeting notes, Slack, docs (shared context for continuity)

**You can also add context manually:** Paste Drive links, emails, or notes into chat and ask to add them to the merchant folder.

## 🔧 Common Issues

**"Returns other SEs' opportunities"**  
→ Check `personal-config.md` has your correct Salesforce UserId

**"Queries return too many results"**  
→ Update quarter dates in `personal-config.md` (Q1: Jan-Mar, Q2: Apr-Jun, Q3: Jul-Sep, Q4: Oct-Dec)

**"Can't find merchant context"**  
→ Run: `@se-assistant "Sync merchant context for [Name]"`

**"MCP not working" / "Tool failed to execute"**  
→ Check Cursor settings → Features → Model Context Protocol  
→ Verify all required MCPs are listed and enabled  
→ Try re-authenticating (may need to re-auth with Google/Salesforce/Slack)  
→ Setup guide: [Shopify MCP Documentation](https://vault.shopify.io/ai/mcp_servers)  
→ Test with: `@se-assistant "Get my Salesforce UserId"` - should return your UserId
