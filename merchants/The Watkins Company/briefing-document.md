### Critical Timeline Pressure ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Board Presentation in ~2 Weeks:**
- Need firm implementation costs for 2026 capex budget approval
- Require 2-3 comparable partner quotes
- Quotes needed by end of week (Oct 31) or tomorrow EOD (Oct 30)
- Without firm numbers, project could be delayed to future budget cycle

### Project Approach & Timeline
- **Target Go-Live**: Shortly after first week of March
- **Estimated Duration**: 17-20 weeks (4-5 months)
- **Timeline Reality**: 5-6 months minimum (per Sultans), potentially 6-9 months
- **Approach**: Phased rollout under consideration (D2C first, then HBB pilot)
- **Key Blocker**: B2B functionality discovery needed for accurate scoping

### Business Case
- **Estimated Savings**: 192 hours across three departments
- **Process Benefits**: Streamlined workflows, improved user experience
- **Platform Pain Points**: Manual commissions (2-3 days/month), promo/discount constraints, slow NetSuite updates
- **Driver**: New HBB commission plan implementation

### Implementation Partners (3 in Play)

1. **Sultans** - Primary partner already engaged
   - Technical expertise in direct sales implementations
   - Recommends Celigo middleware for NetSuite (NOT ERP connector)

### Critical Integration Concerns
1. **Tax Platform Selection**: Sovos recently renewed, but meetings with Avalara and Vertex underway for replacement
2. **Custom Commission Engine**: Manual reconciliation (2-3 days/month), accurate attribution required
3. **NetSuite Integration**: Bidirectional sync (orders, inventory, pricing), Celigo middleware recommended
4. **B2B Functionality**: User limits, custom pricing tiers, payment terms need discovery before accurate scoping
5. **Consultant Attribution**: Thousands of unique URLs, legacy paid ad exceptions must persist
