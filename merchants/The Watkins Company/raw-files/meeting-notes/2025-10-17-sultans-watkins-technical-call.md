## Summary

William Bédard initiated a meeting with Sultans, represented by Mansour Chatti and John Ki, and Watkins' technical team, Tou Yang, Robert Rathman, and Kevin Okome, to discuss a Shopify implementation for Watkins' direct sales, focusing on integrating with NetSuite and resolving challenges like their custom commission engine and tax solution. Mansour Chatti and John Ki highlighted Sultans' expertise in Shopify direct sales and suggested Celigo as a middleware for NetSuite integration, advising against the NetSuite ERP connector due to its limitations for direct sales. Tou Yang expressed concerns about integrating their Soos tax solution and the two-month timeline, which John Ki and Mansour Chatti deemed unrealistic, estimating a minimum of five to six months for a comprehensive implementation. Robert Rathman and Kevin Okome were asked to populate a technical wish list for the project scope, which will be shared with John Ki.

## Action Items

| Owner | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| William Bédard | Look up and confirm estimated timeline for Soos becoming native supported tax calculation service with Shopify | ASAP |
| Steve Popov | Reiterate to Emily and Tyler that Shopify Plus implementation requires 6-7 months (not 3 months) for proper scoping | Next week meeting |
| John Ki (Sultans) | Provide demo of implementations done with similar customers based on high-level requirements | After scope finalization |
| Robert Rathman & Kevin Okome | Start populating technical wish list sheet with detailed requirements | Before next technical call |
| Group | Share technical wish list sheet with John Ki | After population |
| Group | Schedule another technical call after Steve & William meet with Emily and Tyler to finalize scope | TBD |

## Next Steps
1. **Technical Wish List:** Watkins technical team to populate requirements document
2. **Demo from Sultans:** Show similar implementation examples
3. **Scope Meeting:** Steve & William to meet with Emily and Tyler to determine final package
4. **Follow-up Technical Call:** Once scope is defined, reconvene to build out solution

2. **Commission Engine Integration** - Custom development required
3. **NetSuite/Celigo Middleware** - Architecture decision critical for success
4. **Timeline Expectations** - Need to align on 6-7 month realistic timeline vs. initial 2-month expectation
