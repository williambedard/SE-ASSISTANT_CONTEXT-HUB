## Summary

Steve Popov outlined the meeting's objective: to prioritize items for a new system, shifting from a full scope to a phased approach, while Emily Hughes and Tyler Kiel expressed concern about the six-to-nine-month implementation timeline, which William Bédard clarified was a safe estimate due to various factors. Steve provided Shopify Plus platform fees and implementation cost estimates, while Tyler detailed the new HBB commission plan and emphasized the project's incentive to streamline processes and improve user experience, noting estimated savings of 192 hours across three departments. Steve proposed two separate meetings: one for a Shopify payments presentation on Wednesday, the 29th, at 11:00 AM Eastern time, and another for a general Shopify demonstration, tentatively scheduled for Tuesday the 4th or Thursday the 6th.
