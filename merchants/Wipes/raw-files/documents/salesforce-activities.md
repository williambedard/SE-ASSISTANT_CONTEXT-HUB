> Hey Jay,
> 
> Not sure if our teams have spoke in the past but Wipes.com has been flagged as a high priority account for us - That being said, I've blocked off the next 2 weeks specifically for merchants in your vertical and platform.
> 
> I'm going to be doing 1:1 virtual demonstrations on improving ecom systems that actually work and will cut costs and should there be interest I'd like to then coordinate something in person (obviously a lunch and dinner on me is included).
> 
> Would you be opposed to a 15 minute chat some time next week, Jay?

## Critical Requirements from Beau's Email

### ðŸ”´ PRIMARY CONCERN: Multi-Warehouse Shipping
> "We run ShipperHQ for multi-warehouse live UPS ratesâ€¦..so honestly that is probably a primary questionâ€¦..does Shopify handle multi-warehouse live UPS out of the boxâ€¦or use ShipperHQ."

**Action Required**: Prepare clear answer on Shopify's multi-warehouse shipping capabilities

### ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT: Subscriptions
> "subscriptions are important to us as well"

**Action Required**: Demo subscription apps (Recharge, Skio, etc.)

### ðŸŸ¢ CONTEXT: Business Scale
- $100K/month online revenue
- Additional offline revenue
- Beau thinks may not need Enterprise level
- Technically savvy (already tested Shopify)
