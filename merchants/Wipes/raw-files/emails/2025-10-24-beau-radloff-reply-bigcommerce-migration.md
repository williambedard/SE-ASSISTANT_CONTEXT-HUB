## Key Points from Beau's Response

**Migration Intent**: ✅ CONFIRMED
> "We have been on BigC for years and I have started looking at Shopify migration."

**Platform Experience**:
> "I set up a small store just to see the backend….so familiar with most of the setup/mngt."

**Critical Requirements**:

### 1. Multi-Warehouse Shipping (PRIMARY QUESTION)
> "We run ShipperHQ for multi-warehouse live UPS rates…..so honestly that is probably a primary question…..does Shopify handle multi-warehouse live UPS out of the box…or use ShipperHQ."

### 2. Subscriptions
> "Outside of that…subscriptions are important to us as well. I can't recall the app I saw during my test phase…but seemed to work well."

**Business Scale**:
> "Fair warning, we do maybe $100k a month via website (and X more offline)…so probably wouldn't need Enterprise level"

**Meeting Confirmation**:
> "So if you want to do a brief demo my brother and I can attend and follow up with questions"
> "I could chat Tuesday AM or into Wed."

**Meeting scheduled**: Tuesday, October 28, 2025 at 10:30am EDT
