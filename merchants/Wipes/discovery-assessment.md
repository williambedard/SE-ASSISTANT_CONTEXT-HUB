## 5Cs Framework

### 1. Circumstance
**Status**: `[PARTIAL]`

**Business Context**:
- Michigan-based D2C company selling sanitizing/disinfecting wipes
- Founded 2009, established business
- Target customers: Gyms, schools, community centers, direct consumers
- Online revenue: ~$100K/month ($1.2M annually)
- Additional offline revenue (amount TBD)
- Current platform: BigCommerce (multi-year customer)

**Technical Context**:
- Multi-warehouse operations requiring live UPS rates
- Subscription business model component
- Technically savvy team (Beau set up test Shopify store)

**Gaps to Fill**:
- Exact number of warehouses/fulfillment locations
- Product catalog size and complexity
- Team size and technical resources
- Offline revenue and total business scale

### 2. Challenge
**Status**: `[COMPLETE]` âœ…

**Primary Challenge** (from Oct 28 Discovery):
1. **ðŸ”´ HIGH OPERATIONAL COSTS** (MAIN DRIVER):
   - BigCommerce platform monthly costs too high for current scale
   - Subscription service expenses eating into margins
   - Payment processing fees significantly higher than desired
   - Need cost-effective platform without compromising functionality

**Technical Challenges**:
1. **Multi-Warehouse Shipping** - Currently using ShipperHQ on BigCommerce for multi-warehouse live UPS rates. Need equivalent Shopify solution.
2. **Subscription Management** - Important to business model, concerns about data migration process
3. **Platform Migration Complexity** - Years of data and configuration to migrate

**Confirmed Pain Points** (Oct 28):
- Platform costs not justified for $100K/month revenue
- App ecosystem costs adding up
- Payment processing rates too high
- Seeking all-in-one solution with lower total cost of ownership

### 3. Consequence
**Status**: `[PARTIAL]`

**Financial Impact**:
- High operational costs reducing profit margins on $100K/month revenue
- Payment processing fees significantly impacting per-transaction profitability
- Platform + subscription + apps costs creating unsustainable total cost of ownership
- Cost structure preventing profitable growth

**Operational Impact**:
- Platform limitations requiring workarounds and custom development
- Multi-year technical debt on BigCommerce
- Complexity in managing multi-warehouse operations
- Subscription management challenges

**Gaps to Quantify**:
- Exact monthly platform cost (BigCommerce + apps + subscriptions)
- Current payment processing rate vs Shopify Payments rate
- Projected annual savings with Shopify Plus migration
- Growth projections if cost structure improves

### 4. Change Positive (Expected Outcomes)
**Status**: `[PARTIAL]`

**Financial Benefits** (Primary):
- **Reduced operational costs**: Lower platform fees, reduced app costs, better payment processing rates
- **Improved margins**: Cost savings directly improving profitability per transaction
- **Predictable TCO**: Shopify Plus flat-rate pricing vs BigCommerce variable costs

**Operational Benefits**:
- Simplified multi-warehouse shipping with native Shopify capabilities
- Built-in features reducing app dependency
- Better subscription management tools
- Streamlined platform reducing technical debt

**Growth Enablement**:
- Cost structure supporting profitable scaling
- Platform efficiency enabling reinvestment in growth
- Better payment rates improving unit economics

**Needs Quantification**:
- Projected monthly cost savings
- Payment processing rate improvement (basis points)
- Break-even timeline for migration investment
- 12-month ROI projection

### 5. Closing Requirements
**Status**: `[PARTIAL]`

**Decision Makers**:
- âœ… **Beau Radloff** (Co-Owner) - Primary contact, cost-focused, technically engaged
- **Jay Radloff** (Owner/President) - Final decision authority
- **Decision Structure**: Brothers collaborating on evaluation

**Timeline**:
- **Discovery Completed**: Oct 28, 2025 âœ…
- **Close Date**: Dec 31, 2025 (SF target)
- **Next Step**: Arctic Grey (Anthony) migration assessment

**Evaluation Criteria** (from discovery):
- âœ… **Cost reduction** - Primary decision factor
- âœ… **Migration support** - Partner-led (Arctic Grey)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Technical fit** - Multi-warehouse shipping, subscriptions
- ðŸŸ¡ **Migration timeline** - Needs scoping
- ðŸŸ¡ **Total cost analysis** - Needs detailed breakdown

**Gaps to Fill**:
- Formal budget approval process
- Migration timeline requirements (urgency?)
- Plus vs Standard final decision
- Competitive alternatives (WooCommerce? Magento? Stay on BigCommerce?)
