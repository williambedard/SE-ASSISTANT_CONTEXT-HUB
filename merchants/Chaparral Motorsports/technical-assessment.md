## Executive Summary

Chaparral Motorsports is a $7-10M motorsports parts retailer evaluating Shopify Plus to replace their custom platform. Primary driver: **organizational risk from developer dependency**. Not urgent (no deadline), but strong fit. Demo scheduled to prove YMM fitment capabilities and 1.4M SKU performance.

**Key Opportunity**: Replace brittle custom stack with Shopify's automotive-proven ecosystem while keeping best-in-class tools (Klaviyo, Algolia, Signifyd).

---

## Current Platform & Pain Points

### Platform
- **Custom-built website** (tedious to maintain/update)
- **PHP POS** (on-premise, 3 months old, team happy)
- **Braintree payments** (~2.1%, no contract)

### Critical Pain Points
1. **Organizational Risk** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Heavy dependency on 1-2 developers who know custom system
   - Difficult to bring new developers up to speed
   - Knowledge transfer risk if developers leave
   
2. **Integration Complexity** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Partner apps require "a lot of lift" to integrate
   - Each integration needs custom development
   - Expensive vs. Shopify's pre-built ecosystem

3. **Developer Backlog** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Long ticket queue for website changes
   - Business users can't make quick updates
   - Slow response to market opportunities

## Integration Deep-Dive

### Acumatica ERP (‚ö†Ô∏è Pain Point, ‚úÖ Solution Available)
**Current Pain**:
- Poor support (30-60 day ticket responses)
- VAR lacks technical expertise
- Performance issues unaddressed
- Self-hosting due to cloud problems

**Shopify Advantage**:
- First-party integration (Shopify-Acumatica partnership)
- Can leverage relationship for smoother integration
- One-way sync for inventory/products ideal
- May provide better support through partnership

**Future**: Crystal wishes to move ERPs but no appetite for another migration

---

### Channel Advisor (‚úÖ Keep, Use Middleware)
**Current**: Very satisfied, only complaint is cost  
**Function**: Marketplace product + order management

**Strategy**: Use **Dcopify middleware**
- Integrates Channel Advisor ‚Üî Shopify
- Better for complex/technical product data vs. Marketplace Connect
- Handles both product information + order flow

---

### Signifyd Fraud Protection (‚úÖ CRITICAL - Keep)
**Why Critical**:
- Significant fraud history (bad credit cards, call center)
- Provides **insurance** on all orders
- Manages chargebacks ("Such a waste of time to fight them")

**Shopify Integration**: Built into platform  
**Recommendation**: Keep (more sophisticated than Shopify's native fraud detection)
