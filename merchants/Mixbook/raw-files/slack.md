*[INTERNAL-ONLY]*

## Key Updates Timeline

### July 31, 2025 - Major Decision Update
**Source**: #mixbook channel

Key decisions from Mixbook board:
- Decision is less "if" and more "when" to migrate to Shopify
- Deeper engineering investigation needed to understand scope and derisk complexity of untangling monolith tech stack
- Will devote engineering bandwidth to this activity during Q3-Q4
- Company focus right now: peak readiness (Oct-Dec is peak season)
- Next steps: Plan technical discovery with SDG and Domaine (timing TBD)

**Transition**: Chris' paternity leave starts Aug 8, transitioning to new POCs (Arly and CMO)

### August 6, 2025 - Revenue Update
**Source**: DM with Sarah Roberts

Opp devalued in Salesforce - monthly contract value was always incorrect (SF error, not manual). Current costs shared:
- **93% D2C revenue**
- **Actual volume**: $73M D2C, $5M B2B

### August 11, 2025 - Partner Updates

Partner scopes scheduled:
- CMO scheduling with SDG and Domaine for early next week
- CTO out until Thursday, needs to join calls with engineering team leads
- Partners can deliver SOWs immediately after meetings, aiming for delivery by EONW
- Confirmed Plus instance needs signing by September (included in partner SOW timelines)

### September 17-24, 2025 - Weekly Touchbases
**Source**: DM with Sarah Roberts

- No meeting until weekly next week
- Great calls planned with Miami and Mixbook
- Focus: mutual plan and progress tracking

### October 3, 2025 - B2B Revenue Clarification
**Source**: Group DM with Samantha Magder

Major clarification from O'Neal (minute 17:21 in recording):
- "Business customers" (schools + parents purchasing yearbooks) historically seen as **D2C customers**
- May continue this workflow on Shopify
- Through solutioning, could use B2B company profiles if desired
- SDG will include in discovery
- **All historical revenue considered D2C**: $78,769,364 USD (previously split as $73,755,683 D2C + $5,013,681 B2B)

MVF updated and shared back to O'Neal for submission.

### October 6, 2025 - MVF Submitted
**Source**: DM with Sarah Roberts

- MVF from Mixbook is in
- May move meeting, alignment needed on mutual plan coming off ELT
- B2B team informed that separate B2B opp no longer needed

## Deal Status

**Current Stage**: Deal Craft
**Confidence**: High - Board confirmed Shopify as platform of choice
**Timeline**: Q3 engineering investigation → Partner proposals → Q4 signature target (originally Q3, adjusted for investigation bandwidth)
**Blocker**: Peak season focus (Oct-Dec), engineering investigation ongoing

## Technical Context

**Current Platform**: Monolith tech stack (complexity in untangling)
**Peak Season**: October - December (yearbooks)
**Customer Model**: Schools + Parents = D2C workflow (not traditional B2B)
**Engineering Bandwidth**: Dedicated Q3-Q4 for Shopify investigation

## Partner Strategy

**SDG**: Primary - needs one call to deliver preliminary SOW & timeline
**Domaine**: Secondary - also scoping
**Challenge**: Moldova-based Mixbook team slow to coordinate with partners pre-sale
**Approach**: Partners include "codebase deep dive/discovery" in SOW (not before signing)
