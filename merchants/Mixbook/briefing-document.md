Mixbook is a $78.8M D2C photo book and yearbook company in active negotiation for Shopify Plus migration. Executive leadership (CEO Andrew, CFO Raj, CTO DJ) fully aligned and committed to Shopify. Awaiting final API documentation from senior engineer Anatoli to enable STG to complete Statement of Work. Target contract signature November-December 2025 with January 2027 go-live to capture 2027 growth modeling and pre-Mother's Day launch readiness.

**Key Opportunity Metrics:**
- **Revenue**: $6,186,159 USD (contract value)
- **Annual GMV**: $78.8M USD (all D2C - schools use D2C workflow)
- **Close Target**: November 21, 2025
- **Stage**: Deal Craft
- **Close Probability**: High
- **Salesforce Opp**: Mixbook - Plus, SP, SPi

## Merchant Overview

**Company**: Mixbook
**Industry**: Photo products, yearbooks, personalized gifts
**Business Model**: D2C e-commerce (schools + parents = D2C workflow, not traditional B2B)
**Scale**: 
- Annual Revenue: $78,769,364 USD
- Primary Product: Photo books, yearbooks
- Peak Season: October - December
- Geographic: US-based, Moldova engineering team

**Current Platform**: Monolith tech stack
**Technical Complexity**: High - requires engineering investigation to scope untangling

## Challenges

### Business Challenges
1. **Monolith Platform Complexity**: Current tech stack requires deep engineering investigation to understand migration scope
2. **Peak Season Constraint**: Oct-Dec is critical revenue period, limiting implementation bandwidth
3. **Engineering Capacity**: Q3-Q4 dedicated to Shopify investigation and scoping
4. **Partner Coordination**: Moldova-based team creates timezone/coordination challenges with partners

### Technical Challenges
1. **Codebase Deep Dive Required**: Partners need discovery phase to assess migration complexity
2. **Business Model Nuance**: Schools/yearbook customers treated as D2C (not B2B), requiring workflow clarification
3. **Integration Unknowns**: Existing integrations and dependencies need mapping during partner discovery

## Timelines & Next Steps

### Historical Timeline
- **September 24, 2025**: Weekly touchbase established with O'Neal
- **September 29, 2025**: B2B sync with internal teams - clarified schools use D2C workflow, no B2B platform needed
- **October 3, 2025**: MVF prep call - confirmed $78.8M all D2C revenue, Shopify Payments in scope
- **October 6, 2025**: MVF submitted with final revenue figures
- **October 15, 2025**: Scheduled meeting conflicts, executive team heads-down on peak priorities
- **October 22, 2025**: Weekly touchbase - discussed resource constraints and timeline adjustments

### Current Status (October 22, 2025 - Updated)
- **Executive Alignment**: CEO Andrew, CFO Raj, CTO DJ, and David (Product) all convinced of Shopify initiative
- **Main Bottleneck**: Anatoli's bandwidth to compile and send API documentation to STG
  - Senior tech leads (particularly Anatoli) focused on October deliverables
  - This is causing delays in Shopify-related topology changes and resource allocation
- **Timeline Impact**: Delays in API documentation delivery pushing out SoW creation and buy vs. build evaluation
- **Next Touchbase**: One week from Oct 22 (approx Oct 29)
- **Action Items**:
  - O'Neal will ensure Anatoli ships API documentation to STG in first week of November
  - O'Neal will talk to Raj about most recent thinking on Shopify build
  - O'Neal will keep Sarah updated once he speaks to DJ and gets commitment on API doc timeline
  - Sarah to finalize dates on the plan
  - Marketing opportunity: Samantha & Sarah exploring if Shopify can feature Mixbook as incentive

### Next Steps & Critical Path

**Week of November 4 (Post-Halloween):**
1. **Anatoli ships API documentation** to STG (print partner APIs, fulfillment architecture)
   - STG already has: third-party integrations list, coupon/discount types
   - Missing: API documentation from print partners (final blocker)

**Week of November 11 (Board Meeting Week):**
2. **STG delivers Statement of Work** (24-48 hours after receiving API docs)
3. **Board meeting November 11** - resource allocation discussion for 2027 initiatives
4. **Decision on kickoff timing** - ideally December code freeze start

**Late November / Early December:**
5. **Shopify Plus contract signature** (latest: early December to hit January 2027 go-live)
6. **Potential kickoff in December** during code freeze (O'Neal's ideal scenario)

**January 2027 Target Go-Live:**
- Required for 2027 growth modeling in business plan
- Ensures stability before Mother's Day peak (May - yearbook season culmination)
- Allows maximum months on Shopify in 2027 for performance acceleration

### Outstanding Actions
- **Anatoli (Mixbook)**: Complete pre-peak projects by Halloween, ship API documentation to STG first week of November
- **DJ (Mixbook CTO)**: Commit to deadline for API documentation delivery to STG
- **STG**: Create Statement of Work upon receipt of API documentation
- **Shopify (Sarah)**: 
  - Update mutual plan dates to reflect November timeline
  - Explore marketing opportunities (featuring Mixbook as case study incentive)
  - Prepare Shopify Plus contract for review
- **Shopify (Sam)**: Research subsidization options if needed to accelerate decision
- **O'Neal**: Continue internal selling to align execution timing with resource availability

## Business Intelligence

*External Research - Multiple Sources*

**Company Background**: Mixbook specializes in photo books, yearbooks, and personalized gifts with significant presence in school/education market.

**Customer Segments**:
1. **Schools**: Purchase yearbooks in bulk, treated as D2C transactions operationally
2. **Parents**: Purchase individual yearbooks and photo products
3. **Individual Consumers**: Photo books and gifts

**Operational Model**:
- Peak season Oct-Dec (yearbook production cycle)
- Engineering team based in Moldova (creates coordination considerations)
- 93% of revenue through D2C channels
- 7% originally categorized B2B but operationally D2C (schools/yearbooks)

**Growth Indicators**: Board investment in platform modernization, willingness to dedicate Q3-Q4 engineering bandwidth to Shopify investigation demonstrates strategic commitment.

## Notes

- **Revenue Correction**: Original SFDC entry had incorrect split ($73.8M D2C + $5M B2B). Corrected to $78.8M total D2C based on merchant clarification that schools/parents are D2C customers.
- **Partner Strategy**: SDG preferred due to past project portfolio and technical proficiency, despite being more expensive than initially perceived.
- **Contract Timing**: Plus instance signature by September was original target, adjusted for engineering investigation timeline.
- **B2B Consideration**: While B2B company profiles could be used for school customers, merchant may maintain D2C workflow. SDG will include B2B discovery options in SOW but not primary focus.
