# March Performance - Opportunity Briefing

**Last Updated:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** Closed Lost (Oct 27, 2025)

---

## Executive Summary

March Performance (owned by CVF Racing) evaluated Shopify as a BigCommerce replacement for their $6-7M automotive performance parts business. Despite strong technical engagement and solving key blockers (variant limits, B2B requirements), they decided to renew with BigCommerce 12 days before their November 8 deadline due to timing pressure, implementation uncertainty, and $7-8K sunk cost concerns. Future re-engagement opportunity exists in Q3 2026 before their next renewal cycle.

**Key Takeaway:** Technical fit was strong, but timing + implementation confidence killed the deal. Partner involvement should have been pushed harder earlier.

## Merchant Overview

**Company:** CVF Racing

**Business Model:** D2C + B2B (jobbers and dealers)

## Challenges

- Limited B2B functionality
- Concerns about competitor data scraping (Zik Analytics)

**Technical Requirements:**

- **High Variant Count:** Products with 1000+ variant combinations
- **Sales Team Workflow:** Personal shopper model - reps create orders via admin for technical products

**Business Requirements:**
- B2B portal with tiered pricing and payment terms

## Outstanding Actions

### Immediate (Oct 28-29)

  - Option 2: Financial offset ($7-8K PDFs to cover BigC sunk cost)
- [ ] **Luis:** Send graceful close-out email to Brandon thanking for transparency

### Long-term
- [ ] **Luis:** Mark opportunity as Closed Lost in Salesforce
- [ ] **Luis:** Set reminder for Q3 2026 re-engagement (before next BigC renewal)
- [ ] **Team:** Document learnings - push partner involvement earlier for complex technical requirements

## Key Learnings

**What Went Well:**
- Solved variant limit blocker (2048 announcement)
- Addressed B2B requirements comprehensively
- Provided detailed technical solutions (variant/SKU mapping)
- Strong merchant engagement (multiple meetings, scope planner work)

**What Could Have Been Better:**
- **Partner involvement pushed earlier:** Should have introduced automotive fitment partner in first week to de-risk implementation
- **Timeline management:** Nov 8 deadline created impossible pressure; should have explored month-to-month extension earlier
- **Sunk cost mitigation:** $7-8K BigCommerce waste concern could have been addressed with PDFs upfront

**Future Approach:**
- For complex technical requirements (automotive fitment, complex variants), introduce proven partner in discovery phase
- For tight renewal timelines, explore contract extension options immediately
- Address sunk cost concerns proactively with financial offsets
