# Brandon Johnson - Staying with BigCommerce

**Date:** Monday, October 27, 2025 @ 8:00 AM CST  
**From:** Brandon Johnson (brandon@cvfracing.com)  
**To:** Luis Eduardo Di Meco  
**Subject:** Re: Shopify Follow-up

## Email Content

> "Luis, We are going to be sticking with BigCommerce for right now. Currently the..."

**Note:** Full email body not accessible via Gmail MCP, but message is clear - CVF Racing/March Performance decided to stay with BigCommerce and renew their November 8 contract.

## Context
This email came 12 days before their BigCommerce renewal deadline (Nov 8, 2025).

## Timeline Leading to Decision
- **Oct 15:** Technical discovery meeting - team engaged, Brandon filling out scope planner
- **Oct 22:** William sent detailed technical analysis on variant/SKU mapping solution
- **Oct 23:** Luis forwarded William's analysis to Brandon/Duane/Sam for feedback
- **Oct 24-26:** No response from merchant
- **Oct 27:** Brandon confirms staying with BigCommerce

## Likely Decision Factors
1. **Timing pressure**: 12 days to Nov 8 renewal = high migration risk
2. **Technical uncertainty**: Couldn't replicate auto-fitment logic cleanly in trial
3. **Implementation approach**: Wanted to DIY but complexity requires partner
4. **Financial concern**: Would waste $7-8K on unused BigCommerce if launched Feb 2026
5. **Risk aversion**: Safer to renew known platform vs uncertain migration

## Status
- Opportunity effectively closed lost (though Salesforce stage still shows "Solution")
- Next opportunity window: Q3 2026 (before next BigCommerce renewal)
