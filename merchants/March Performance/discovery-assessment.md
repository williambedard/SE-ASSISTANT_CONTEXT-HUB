# March Performance - Discovery Assessment

**Last Updated:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** Closed Lost (Oct 27, 2025)

---

## 5Cs Framework Assessment

### 1. Circumstance **[COMPLETE]**

**Business Situation:**
- CVF Racing operates 3 automotive brands: March Performance ($6-7M), CVF Racing ($24-25M), CVF Off-Road
- March Performance = secondary brand, test case for potential larger CVF Racing migration
- 7 years on BigCommerce with no platform innovation
- High technical capability team: Duane (IT/dev, 10 years), Brandon (products/data), Sam (design)
- Successfully migrated brands previously (Volusion‚ÜíBigC, Magento‚ÜíBigC)
- Implementing custom AI for email support (launching within week of discovery)

**Market Position:**
- Automotive performance parts niche (motorsports)
- Complex product catalog: ~80,000 SKUs with automotive fitment requirements
- Combined D2C + B2B model (jobbers and dealers)
- Sales team acts as technical advisors (personal shopper workflow)
- Competitor landscape includes other BigCommerce and Shopify merchants (tracked via Zik Analytics)

**Current Platform Contract:**
- BigCommerce annual renewal: **November 8, 2025** (12-day window at time of Oct 27 decision)
- $45K total (3 domains), March Performance = $12K (~22%)
- Order-based pricing model (~25,000 orders/year)

---

### 2. Challenge **[COMPLETE]**

**Business Pain Points:**
- **Platform stagnation:** 7 years without meaningful BigCommerce innovation
- **Growth constraint:** Cannot expand catalog due to 600-variant limit (need 2000+)
- **B2B limitations:** Insufficient native functionality for dealer/jobber programs
- **Competitive disadvantage:** Competitors can scrape revenue/product data via Zik Analytics
- **Operational inefficiency:** Sales team forced to navigate frontend for technical order creation
- **Financial risk:** $7-8K sunk cost if migrate Feb 2026 after Nov 8 renewal

**Technical Challenges:**
- **Automotive fitment complexity:** Year/Make/Model (YMM) compatibility system required
- **SKU mapping:** Customer selections must generate deterministic warehouse SKUs for ERP
- **Variant explosion:** Products with 1000+ combinations exceed platform limits
- **BOM management:** Make-to-order kits require production code generation
- **ERP integration:** Migrating to Acumatica, need robust connector for products/inventory/orders/pricing

**Implementation Concerns:**
- Prefer DIY approach but recognize complexity may require partner
- $7-8K waste on unused BigCommerce (Feb launch after Nov renewal)
- 12-day decision window insufficient for confident migration commitment
- Trial couldn't replicate variant/SKU logic cleanly
- No automotive fitment partner validated to de-risk implementation

---

### 3. Consequence **[PARTIAL]**

**Quantified Risks (Staying with BigCommerce):**
- **Catalog expansion blocked:** Cannot launch products with >600 variants
- **Revenue opportunity cost:** (Not quantified during discovery)
- **B2B program limitations:** (Not quantified during discovery)
- **Competitor intelligence disadvantage:** (Not quantified during discovery)

**Cost of Inaction:**
- Continue paying $12K/year for stagnant platform
- Miss opportunity to test Shopify before committing to $24-25M CVF Racing migration
- Operational inefficiency continues for sales team workflow
- Platform increasingly outdated as market evolves

**Gaps:**
- Never quantified revenue impact of variant limit constraint
- Never calculated B2B program expansion opportunity with proper portal
- Never estimated sales team efficiency gain with admin order creation
- Never assessed total cost of bot/scraping exposure

---

### 4. Change Positive **[PARTIAL]**

**Expected Outcomes:**
- **2048 variant limit** enables full catalog expansion (announced Oct 15 - perfect timing!)
- **B2B portal** with tiered pricing, payment terms for dealer/jobber programs
- **Draft orders** streamline sales team workflow (5 reps processing technical orders)
- **Acumatica integration** via certified connector or iPaaS
- **Platform innovation** access to Shopify's continuous feature releases
- **Pathway to CVF Racing** ($24-25M) migration if March Performance successful

**Expected Benefits:**
- Eliminate platform constraint on product expansion
- Improve B2B customer experience and dealer onboarding
- Increase sales team efficiency with admin-based order creation
- Modernize tech stack for future growth
- De-risk larger CVF Racing migration with proven approach

**Success Metrics (Not Defined):**
- Gaps:
  - Never established migration success criteria
  - Never defined post-launch KPIs
  - Never quantified efficiency gains
  - Never set timeline for CVF Racing decision point

---

### 5. Closing Requirements **[PARTIAL]**

**Decision Criteria (Implied, Not Explicit):**
- Technical feasibility of variant/SKU mapping solution
- Confidence in automotive fitment implementation
- Clear timeline and cost for Feb 2026 launch
- Mitigation of $7-8K BigCommerce sunk cost
- Ability to handle migration internally or with minimal partner support

**Timeline:**
- BigCommerce renewal: **November 8, 2025**
- Target Shopify launch: **February 2026**
- Decision made: **October 27, 2025** (12 days before renewal)

**Stakeholders:**
- **Nathan French (CEO):** Economic buyer, ultimate signatory on BigCommerce renewal - **NEVER ENGAGED (Critical Miss)**
- **Duane Birchem:** Manager, Marketing / IT/development lead, primary technical evaluator, PRIMARY CONTACT
- **Brandon Johnson:** eCommerce Specialist, product/data management, scope planner owner
- **Melanie Hinderscheid:** Social Media Marketing
- **Sam:** Design/social, supporting role

**Next Steps (At Time of Oct 15 Meeting):**
- William: Build example complex product, record video demo
- Luis: Send requirements doc, record pricing video, create mutual action plan
- Merchant: Complete scope planner, review William's solution

**Gaps:**
- Never engaged owner/decision-maker directly
- Never established formal decision timeline
- Never defined "go/no-go" criteria explicitly
- Never created mutual close plan with partner involvement
- Never addressed $7-8K sunk cost proactively

---

## EPoV (Executive Point of View) Readiness **[NOT READY]**

**Required for Strong EPoV:**
- ‚úÖ **Financial business case:** Platform cost understood ($12K/year BigC)
- üîÑ **Quantified value:** Benefits mentioned but not quantified (revenue impact, efficiency gains)
- ‚úÖ **Shopify solution alignment:** Technical fit validated (2048 variants, B2B, draft orders)
- ‚ùå **Reference/case studies:** No automotive migration examples provided
- ‚ùå **ROI projection:** Never calculated payback period or total value
- ‚ùå **Risk mitigation:** Sunk cost concern identified but not addressed with solution

**Overall Assessment:** EPoV was NOT ready. Had strong technical fit but lacked:
- Quantified business case for owner
- ROI calculation including efficiency gains
- Reference examples of similar migrations
- Financial offset for sunk cost concern
- Partner timeline/cost commitment

---

## Challenger Approach Application

**Reframe Opportunities (Missed):**
- **Current Frame:** "We need to migrate platforms because of variant limits"
- **Could Have Reframed:** "Variant constraint is blocking X% revenue opportunity in high-margin product categories - migration enables Y% catalog expansion at Z investment"

- **Current Frame:** "BigCommerce renewal is coming up"
- **Could Have Reframed:** "Annual renewal locks you into another year of platform constraint - month-to-month extension gives optionality to migrate when ready"

- **Current Frame:** "We want to DIY the migration"
- **Could Have Reframed:** "DIY saves implementation cost but extends timeline and risk - partner de-risks Feb launch and frees your team for core business"

**Take Control (Missing):**
- Never established clear decision framework
- Never created mutual close plan with milestones
- Never engaged owner/economic buyer
- Never addressed objections proactively (sunk cost, implementation confidence)

**Rational + Emotional Impact:**
- **Rational:** Technical fit validated, cost understood
- **Emotional:** Never tapped into frustration of 7-year platform stagnation, excitement of 2048-variant announcement, or urgency of renewal deadline

---

## Discovery Gaps by Priority

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Deal-Breaking Gaps)
1. **No partner engagement:** Automotive fitment specialist never introduced to de-risk implementation
2. **No proof of concept:** Variant/SKU solution documented but not demonstrated in working trial store
3. **No owner engagement:** Economic buyer never involved in decision process
4. **No financial offset:** $7-8K sunk cost concern identified but not addressed with PDFs
5. **No ERP validation:** Acumatica connector capabilities not tested with merchant's requirements

### üü° IMPORTANT (Weak Discovery)
6. **No quantified value:** Revenue impact of variant expansion never calculated
7. **No reference examples:** Automotive migration case studies not provided
8. **No timeline commitment:** Partner assessment for Feb 2026 launch never scoped
9. **No ROI model:** Total value of migration (efficiency + revenue + modernization) not projected
10. **No decision framework:** Go/no-go criteria never established with merchant

### üü¢ NICE-TO-HAVE (Minor Gaps)
11. **No app cost breakdown:** Total monthly app expenses not finalized
12. **No bot mitigation details:** Specific tactics mentioned but not documented
13. **No split payment app:** Recommendation committed but not delivered (lower priority)

---

## Why This Deal Was Lost

**Root Cause: Timing + Implementation Confidence**

**Contributing Factors:**
1. **12-day decision window** insufficient for migration confidence with complex requirements
2. **Partner gap** - No automotive fitment specialist engaged to validate approach and commit to timeline
3. **Trial didn't prove solution** - Variant/SKU mapping documented but not demonstrated working
4. **Sunk cost unaddressed** - $7-8K BigCommerce waste concern never mitigated with financial offset
5. **DIY preference** - Merchant underestimated complexity, Shopify didn't push partner involvement hard enough early

**What We Did Right:**
- Solved variant limit blocker (2048 announcement Oct 15 - perfect timing!)
- Validated B2B portal fit
- Confirmed draft order workflow for sales team
- Built strong rapport (multiple meetings, scope planner engagement)
- Provided detailed technical documentation

**What We Missed:**
- Introducing automotive fitment partner in first week
- Building working proof of concept in trial store
- Engaging owner/economic buyer directly
- Addressing $7-8K concern proactively with PDFs
- Creating urgent decision framework despite short timeline

---

## Future Re-engagement Strategy

**When to Re-engage:** Q3 2026 (3 months before next BigCommerce renewal)

**Approach for Next Cycle:**
1. **Partner-first:** Introduce automotive fitment specialist in first conversation with reference examples
2. **Proof early:** Build working example of complex product within first week of evaluation
3. **Financial clarity:** Address sunk cost concerns proactively with PDF options
4. **Timeline extension:** Explore month-to-month contract option immediately if renewal <60 days
5. **Owner engagement:** Involve economic buyer early with quantified business case
6. **ROI model:** Calculate total value including revenue expansion, efficiency gains, modernization benefits

**Relationship Status:** Strong - merchant engaged seriously, appreciates transparency, technical fit validated. This is a timing/execution issue, not a solution-fit issue.
