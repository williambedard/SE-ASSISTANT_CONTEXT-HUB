## üìä Technical Requirements

### Current Technical Stack
- **Platform:** BigCommerce (both D2C and B2B stores)
- **PIM:** Custom-built (by John & Clay)
- **ERP:** NetSuite (direct connection already established)
- **Shipping:** Shipper HQ (not happy with it, looking to simplify)
- **Returns:** Narvar (unsatisfactory experience)
- **International:** Zonos (separate checkout, limited customization)
- **Development:** Semi-headless on BigCommerce
- **Agency Partner:** Trellis

### Core Requirements (Confirmed June 2025)

**B2B Functionality:**
- ‚úÖ Multiple buyers per company profile
- ‚úÖ Custom pricing/catalogs per customer segment
- ‚úÖ Payment terms (Net 7, 15, 30, 60, 90 days)
- ‚úÖ Order approval workflow (draft orders for review)
- ‚úÖ Wholesale shipping rates (different from D2C)
- ‚úÖ Trade show order creation (manual orders, custom items)

**Shipping Complexity:**
- ‚úÖ State-based shipping rates for furniture
- ‚úÖ Split shipments (bags ship from VA, furniture from NC)
- ‚úÖ Freight shipping for large items
- ‚úÖ Real-time carrier rates for small parcels
- ‚úÖ International shipping with duties/taxes

**Product Management:**
- ‚úÖ Variable product structures (not all products have same variants)
- ‚úÖ Out-of-stock ordering (furniture is made-to-order)
- ‚úÖ Draft product workflow (work before publishing)
- ‚úÖ Per-variant visibility controls
- ‚úÖ Combined listings (show variants on PLP, merge on PDP)

**Integrations:**
- ‚úÖ NetSuite ERP (existing direct connection or native connector)
- ‚úÖ Custom PIM (already built, needs API mapping)
- ‚úÖ Shopify Payments (replacing current processor)
- ‚úÖ Native returns management (replace Narvar)
- ‚úÖ Markets for international (replace Zonos)

**Development Environment:**
- ‚úÖ Proper sandbox/staging with feature parity
- ‚úÖ GitHub integration for CI/CD
- ‚úÖ Multiple theme versions for testing
- ‚úÖ Expansion stores for integration testing

### Product Catalog
- **Product Types:** Furniture, bags, accessories, leather samples/hides
- **Fulfillment:** Made-to-order furniture, stocked accessories
- **Locations:** Virginia (accessories), North Carolina (furniture)
- **SKU Count:** TBD (requirements doc exists but not fully populated)

### Current Pain Points (Migration Drivers)

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Reporting Limitations** - Cannot create custom reports, must export CSVs and manually filter
2. **Development Environment** - No proper sandbox, duplicating work across staging
3. **Checkout Restrictions** - Can't customize without breaking
4. **Product Variant Limitations** - All products must have same variant structure
5. **Out-of-Stock Handling** - Cannot sell out-of-stock items (had to set furniture stock to 3 million)
6. **Login Experience** - B2B login flow confuses D2C customers
