## 🎯 Key Discussion Topics

### Current Pain Points with BigCommerce

**1. Reporting Limitations**
- Cannot create custom reports without exporting CSV files
- Must manually filter data in Excel
- Example: Trying to pull data for "Seven Hills" collection requires exporting full product catalog and manually deleting rows
- Difficult to combine different data variations for custom reporting
- While developers can build custom dashboards, Janine prefers utilizing native platform tools

**2. Page Builder Flexibility**
- Current setup is very block-based
- Limited visual flexibility on the front end
- Looking into Instant.so page builder for more flexibility
- Want balance between structure and creativity

**3. Development Environment Issues**
- BigCommerce lacks proper sandbox environment with feature parity to production
- Testing integrations and apps is very difficult
- Two stores but only one sandbox
- Having to duplicate work to keep staging sites in parity
- Paying agency hours just to duplicate work

**4. Checkout Customization**
- Difficult to add anything to checkout without breaking functionality
- Example: Want to add messaging for monogrammed items (additional 2 business days)
- Fear of "everything's going to break" with any checkout modifications

### Shopify Solutions Demonstrated

**1. Analytics & Reporting**
- Customizable analytics dashboard per user role
- "Explorations" feature = custom SQL-like queries to mine data
- Can build custom reports without exporting CSVs
- Demo showed how to create filtered reports on the fly

**2. Theme Customization**
- Shopify templating language allows extensive customization
- GitHub integration for version control and CI/CD pipelines
- Can customize sections while maintaining point-and-click interface for business users
- **Combined Listings** feature: Display variants (e.g., colors) on collection pages, merge on product page

**3. Development Environment**
- **Front-end changes:** Multiple theme versions connected to Git branches within same admin
- **Backend/Integration testing:** Up to 9 expansion stores (sandbox environments) on Shopify Plus
- Can quickly spin up and test integrations, apps, ERPs without affecting live store

**4. Checkout Extensibility**
- Core checkout elements cannot be removed (contact, delivery info)
- BUT can extend checkout with custom messages, upsells, loyalty blocks
- Checkout blocks recently released - easier to add functionality
- Extensions can be built or installed via apps

### B2B Discussion

**Elizabeth's Requirements:**
- B2B wholesale business with different pricing, terms, and tax exemptions
- Customers need D2C-like storefront experience with their specific pricing
- Payment terms support needed

**Shopify's B2B Capabilities:**
- Company profiles for managing B2B customers
- Catalogs (price lists) for custom pricing
- B2B buyers get D2C storefront experience with their pricing upon login
- Follow-up call needed for deeper B2B discussion

## 📌 Important Quotes

**Janine on reporting:**
> "In order to really do that, what we're having to do is filter down like we're having to do a pull of our full category, full product collection, and then just manually delete rows in a CSV file."

**Janine on sandbox issues:**
> "I really don't love paying for hours to just be used to duplicate work to keep our staging sites in parity. It's really painful."

**On BigCommerce vs Shopify:**
> "We were initially guided towards Big Commerce for their dedicated B2B leather store due to its wholesale capabilities."
