## 📝 Meeting Summary

Comprehensive B2B demo and technical Q&A covering wholesale complexities, shipping/returns, international orders, product variations, and project management. Deep dive into Shopify's B2B capabilities and native features.

---

## 🎯 Topics Covered

### 1. Brand Structure & Expansion Stores

**Clarification on "One Brand":**
- Both mooreandgiles.com and mooreandgilesleather.com qualify as one brand under Shopify Plus
- Consistent branding (logo, design, domain similarity)
- B2B leather store can be an expansion store (no separate contract needed)
- **Leather Store Current Model:** Free leather samples (no revenue), plans to eventually sell leather hides

**Key Point:** Both stores under one Plus plan, with 9 expansion stores available

---

### 2. Project Management & Migration Support

**Janine's Concern:**
- Internal dev team (John & Clay) lacks project manager
- Can't effectively PM an entire replatform
- Wants to consolidate from two agencies to one

**Shopify's Model:**
- **Launch Engineer:** Platform onboarding and education support
- **Merchant Success Manager:** Ongoing feature updates and optimization
- **Agency Partners:** Handle project management and implementation
- Sarah offered to introduce third-party Shopify Plus partners

**Current Setup:**
- Trellis: Good partners, but Janine wants more hands-on PM approach
- Internal team: Custom PIM builders, capable front-end devs
- Direct NetSuite connection already established

---

### 3. B2B Features Deep Dive

#### Company Profiles
- Multiple B2B buyers can be associated with single company account
- Each company can have:
  - Multiple shipping locations
  - Custom payment terms (Net 7, 15, 30, 60, 90 days available)
  - Order submission rules (submit directly or require review)
  - Checkout rules (ship to any address vs. on-file addresses only)

**William demonstrated:**
- Creating and managing company profiles
- Associating individual buyers to companies
- Setting location-specific terms

#### B2B Catalogs & Price Lists
- Create custom price lists (catalogs) for different customer segments
- Pricing options:
  - Percentage discount across catalog
  - Custom price per product/SKU
  - Quantity-based pricing (volume discounts)
- **Janine's reaction:** "Robust and easy to understand"

#### B2B Storefront Experience
- Unified admin for D2C and B2B
- Storefront toggle to switch between D2C and B2B views
- Logged-in B2B customers see:
  - Custom pricing
  - Payment terms at checkout
  - Order history and pending (draft) orders
  - Vaulted company cards
  - Company-specific catalogs

**Demo showed:**
- Login flow and location selection
- Dynamic pricing changes after login
- Quick order functionality for B2B
- Draft order workflow (submit for review, then approve)

---

### 4. Order Management

#### Manual Order Creation
**Janine's Use Case:** Trade shows where they take orders in person, often for out-of-stock items

**Shopify Solutions:**
- Create orders with custom items (don't need to exist in catalog)
- Add custom line items with pricing
- Attach notes for internal team
- Use Shopify POS for faster mobile ordering
- **Draft Orders:** Orders requiring review before payment capture

#### NetSuite Integration
- Native connector available (Oracle-built)
- Third-party apps also available
- Orders sync to NetSuite automatically
- Custom SKUs created in Shopify can sync to NetSuite for product creation
- **Janine confirmed:** Their devs can handle the integration

---

### 5. Shipping Complexity

#### Furniture Shipping Requirements
- **Matrix-based pricing:** Virginia to Virginia (lower cost) vs. Virginia to California (higher cost)
- State-level pricing with flat rates
- Currently using Shipper HQ (not user-friendly per Janine)

**Shopify Native Capabilities:**
- State-level shipping rates
- Real-time carrier rates or flat rates
- Conditional pricing based on:
  - Weight
  - Order total
  - Product type
- **Shipping Profiles:** Different rules for furniture vs. accessories vs. B2B orders

#### Split Shipments
**Challenge:** Customer buying bag (ships from Virginia) + sofa (ships from North Carolina)

**Shopify Solution:**
- Native split shipment support
- Two tracking numbers automatically created
- Separate shipping costs shown at checkout
- Customer account shows both shipments

#### Dynamic Packing / Volumetric Shipping
- Shopify can use predefined package sizes based on cart contents
- Apps available for advanced optimization
- Not currently used by Moore & Giles, but available if needed

---

### 6. International Orders & Markets

**Current Setup:** Using Zonos
- Can't customize experience
- Separate checkout (terrible experience per Janine)
- Low international order volume

**Shopify Markets Solution:**
- Set up international zones with specific rules per market
- Control per market:
  - Product availability
  - Pricing adjustments
  - Duties and taxes
  - Shipping methods
  - Storefront localization (language, currency)
- **Catch-all market:** For less common destinations
- NO separate checkout - unified experience

**Janine's Focus:**
- US + maybe 2 other countries as main markets
- Catch-all for everything else

---

### 7. Product Variations & Inventory

#### Current BigCommerce Pain Point
- Cannot launch products with different variation structures
- All products must have same variants
- Requires extensive custom development

**Shopify Native Support:**
- Each product can have its own variant structure
- No limitation on mixing variant types
- Combined Listings: Show variants separately on PLP, merge on PDP

#### Product Visibility Controls
**Janine's Requirements:**
- Work on products before publishing (hide them)
- Show products as out of stock
- Allow ordering out-of-stock items (furniture is made-to-order)

**BigCommerce Issue:**
> "Big Commerce doesn't let you order products that are out of stock ever at all. So our stock of our furniture is like three million because that was a ridiculous number that we knew would never go out of stock."

**Shopify Solution:**
- Draft products (work on them before publishing)
- Per-SKU visibility controls
- **Continue selling when out of stock** option (per variant)
- Waitlist apps available for pre-orders

---

### 8. Returns Management

**Native Shopify Features:**
- Customer-initiated returns from account
- Admin-initiated returns
- Partial refunds
- Non-returnable items (can mark and auto-deny)
- Return reasons captured
- Pending refunds (check item condition before refunding)

**Current Setup:** Using Narvar (unsatisfactory experience)

**Gift with Purchase:** Janine mentioned BigCommerce handles non-returnable gifts well - Shopify supports this too

---

### 9. B2B Checkout & Payment Options

**Demonstrated:**
- Pre-filled information for logged-in B2B customers
- Submit order for review (creates draft order)
- Choose payment terms (Net 90 shown)
- **Deposit feature** available for large ticket items (percentage-based)

**Wholesale Shipping Methods:**
- Can differ from D2C
- Separate shipping profiles for B2B orders

---

## 🎯 Concerns Addressed

**Login Experience Concern:**
> "I think as a customer though it's disruptive from like if you're just trying to log in and see if your order shipped like it's disruptive and confusing to be taken somewhere where there's like the main navigation isn't there and you know it feels very backend."

**Resolution:** William explained alternative login flows can be built, and themes like Horizon offer more D2C-oriented experiences. Customizable via theme development.

---
