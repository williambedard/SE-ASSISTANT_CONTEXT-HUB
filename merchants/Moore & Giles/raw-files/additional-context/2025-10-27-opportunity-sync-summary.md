## üéØ Migration Drivers (Validated in June)

**Critical BigCommerce Pain Points:**
1. **Reporting Nightmare** - Must export CSVs and manually filter data
2. **No Real Sandbox** - Duplicating work to keep staging in parity
3. **Checkout Brittleness** - Can't customize without breaking
4. **Product Variant Limitations** - All products must have same structure
5. **Out-of-Stock Problem** - Can't sell OOS items (furniture stock set to 3 million)
6. **B2B Login Confusion** - Separate flow confuses D2C customers

**Quote from Janine:**
> "I feel like I need to go back to school and learn math again to use [Shipper HQ]."

> "Big Commerce doesn't let you order products that are out of stock ever at all. So our stock of our furniture is like three million because that was a ridiculous number that we knew would never go out of stock."
