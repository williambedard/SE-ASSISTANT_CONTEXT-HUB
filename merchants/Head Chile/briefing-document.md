## Challenges

### Critical Challenge - Partner Gating (Identified Sept 17, 2025)
**Issue**: Yurii Kuzminov from Axceleris has been gating Shopify from meeting with Head Chile merchant. Axceleris is platform agnostic, suspected preference for Magento project (higher agency revenue potential). This is preventing deal progression.

**Escalation**: Reported to Forrest Riddle (SE leadership) Sept 17, 2025

### Technical Challenges
1. **Migration Complexity**: Adobe Commerce to Shopify Plus migration
2. **Partner Conflict of Interest**: Platform agnostic partner may be steering toward alternative platform
3. **Deal Velocity**: Close date Oct 31 at risk due to partner gatekeeping

## Notes

**Partner Conflict Concern (Sept 17):**
> "Yurii from Axceleris has been gating us from meeting with the merchant. This partner is Platform Agnostic, which makes us think he would prefer a Magento project for the increased revenue it would bring to his agency. This situation is preventing us from moving the deal forward and closing it in quarter."

**Discovery Call Context (Aug 22):**
- Technical assessment created and shared
- Adobe Commerce migration pathway discussed
- Similar implementation examples reviewed (tennisexpress.com)

**Last Sync**: October 27, 2025 - Partner gating issue remains unresolved. Deal at risk unless direct merchant access established.
