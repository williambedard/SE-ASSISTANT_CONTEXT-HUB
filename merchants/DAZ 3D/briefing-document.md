## Notes

**ROI Case (October 16):**
- Brad's ROI analysis was "very helpful" in leading ELT discussion
- Focus on cost issue: International credit card transaction costs
  - Shopify rates higher than current platform
  - But PayPal parity pricing resolves CEO concern
  - CEO response: "Okay, we can live with that"

**Scheduling Constraints:**
- Week of Oct 21: Brad tied up with major customer milestone delivery
- Week of Oct 28: Brad unavailable first 3.5 days (Thursday afternoon and Friday available)
- Brad generally flexible, but customer deliverables can cause conflicts

**Contract Details:**
- Brad downloaded PDF copy of Plus MSA (original DocuSign voided due to age)
- Shopify won't accept red lines to MSA
- Trial store required on contract (Steve to create)
- Sarah has up-to-date version ready

**International Business:**

- Key selling point: Shopify Managed Markets tool for MOR support
- Reduces complexity of managing international tax/compliance

**Migration from Homegrown:**
- Platform is 7 years old (moved off Magento 7 years ago)
- Major pain point: Analytics dependency on single team member
- Significant cost savings opportunity vs maintaining homegrown platform

**Partnership Approach:**
- Brad scheduling both Emila and SG pitches for same day (Oct 25)
- Decision expected by end of that day or following Monday
- Partner funding request contingent on Brad's selection
