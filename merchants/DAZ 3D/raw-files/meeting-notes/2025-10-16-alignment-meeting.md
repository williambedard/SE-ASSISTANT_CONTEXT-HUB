# DAZ 3D / Shopify: Alignment Meeting - October 16, 2025

**Date**: October 16, 2025 (1:59pm MDT)  
**Type**: Alignment / ROI Review  
**Attendees**: Brad Nielson (DAZ 3D), Sarah Roberts (Shopify AE), Samantha Magder (Shopify MM Leader), William BÃ©dard (Shopify SE)

## Key Takeaways

- **ROI Case Approved**: Brad's ROI analysis presented to ELT went "very well" - CEO approved moving forward
- **PayPal Parity Pricing**: CEO comfortable once Brad clarified PayPal would be level with current rates
- **ELT Meeting Scheduled**: October 23 at 11am Mountain for final team alignment
- **Partner Pitches Scheduled**: October 25 (Friday) - both Emila and SG on same day
- **Target Signature**: October 31, 2025
- **Launch Engineer Confirmed**: Will to provide 3-month post-signature support

## Summary

Brad reported that his ROI presentation to the DAZ 3D executive leadership team went very well. The CEO initially had concerns about international credit card transaction costs being higher with Shopify, but approved moving forward once Brad clarified that PayPal rates would be at parity with their current platform. CEO's response: "Okay, we can live with that."

The team aligned on scheduling an ELT meeting for Oct 23 to ensure the executive team is comfortable with Shopify and the implementation approach. Brad was managing a major customer milestone delivery the week of Oct 21, so scheduling was constrained to Thursday Oct 23 at 11am Mountain.

Sam raised the PayPal exemption topic, noting that an Oct 31 signature date would significantly help their advocacy case internally. Sarah requested confirmation on partner selection (between Emila and SG) as Shopify can only request partner funds after Brad makes his choice. Brad planned to schedule both partner pitches for Friday Oct 25.

Brad acknowledged he needed to review the Plus MSA (had computer crash and lost to-do list, but has PDF copy). Sarah clarified that Shopify won't accept red lines to the MSA but is happy to answer questions.
