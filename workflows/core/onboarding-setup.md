# SE-NTRAL Setup - Interactive Onboarding

**Purpose:** ONE-TIME setup to create your personal-config.md

**This guide:** How to configure your Salesforce UserId, quarter dates, and preferences  
**After setup:** See `quick-start.md` for daily workflows and merchant folder creation

**Estimated time:** 2 minutes

---

## Setup Workflow (Automated)

When a user triggers setup, SE-Assistant should:

### Step 1: Check Existing Setup
```bash
# Check if personal-config.md exists
if [ -f "personal-config.md" ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ personal-config.md exists"
  # Validate it has required fields
else
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  personal-config.md not found - starting setup"
fi
```

### Step 2: Copy Template
```bash
cp templates/personal-config-template.md personal-config.md
```

### Step 3: Get Salesforce UserId
Use Revenue MCP to fetch the user's Salesforce UserId:
```
@revenue-mcp SELECT Id, Email, Name FROM User WHERE Email = '[user.email@shopify.com]'
```

### Step 4: Interactive Form Fill
Prompt the user for:
1. **Salesforce UserId** (auto-populated from Step 3, user confirms)
2. **Current Quarter** (auto-detect based on today's date, user confirms)
   - Q1: Jan 1 - Mar 31
   - Q2: Apr 1 - Jun 30
   - Q3: Jul 1 - Sep 30
   - Q4: Oct 1 - Dec 31
3. **Primary AE #1 Name** (user provides)
4. **Primary AE #2 Name** (optional, user provides)
5. **Timezone** (auto-detect from system, user confirms)
6. **Work Hours** (default: 9am-5pm, user can customize)

### Step 5: Write personal-config.md
Auto-fill the template with collected information.

### Step 6: Validate Setup
Test the configuration:
```
@se-assistant "Show my open SE opportunities"
```

Expected result: Returns ONLY opportunities where user is Primary SE.

### Step 7: Success Confirmation
```

```bash

#    - quarter: [Current Q# YYYY]
#    - start_date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
#    - end_date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
#    - primary_ae_1: [AE Name]
#    - timezone: [Your timezone]

# 4. Test it
@se-assistant "Show my open SE opportunities"
```

## Validation Checklist

After setup, verify:
- ‚úÖ `personal-config.md` exists in workspace root
- ‚úÖ Salesforce UserId is populated (format: 18-character ID starting with `005`)
- ‚úÖ Quarter dates match current Shopify fiscal quarter
- ‚úÖ Query returns ONLY your opportunities (not other SEs')
- ‚úÖ merchants/ folder exists (empty until first opportunity created)

---

## Common Setup Issues

### "Can't find personal-config.md"
‚Üí File must be in workspace root: `/Users/[you]/SE-NTRAL/personal-config.md`  
‚Üí Not in merchants/ or workflows/ subfolders

### "Query returns other SEs' opportunities"
‚Üí Check `salesforce_user_id` field in personal-config.md  
‚Üí Must match YOUR UserId exactly (case-sensitive)

### "Quarter dates are wrong"
‚Üí Update `start_date` and `end_date` in personal-config.md  
‚Üí Use Shopify fiscal quarters (not calendar quarters)

---

## What Happens After Setup?

**Your workspace is now personalized:**
- All Salesforce queries filter by YOUR UserId
- Priority dashboard shows YOUR opportunities
- Quarter filters focus on YOUR current Q deals
- Calendar rules reflect YOUR work preferences

**Start working:**
```
@se-assistant "New Opportunity: [First Company Name]"
@se-assistant "New Launch Case: [First Company Name]"
```

This creates your first merchant folder with auto-populated context from:
- Salesforce (opportunity/case data)
- Gmail (email threads)
- Slack (conversations)
- Google Drive (documents)
- Web research (company intelligence)

**Note:** Use "New Opportunity" for pre-sales work, "New Launch Case" for post-sales implementation advisory.
