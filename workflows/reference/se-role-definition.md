## Role Overview

### Primary Purpose
**Own the technical win in the sales cycle:** qualify, de-risk, and design a viable Shopify solution that meets business and technical requirements so the buyer can say "yes" with confidence.

**Translation:** Translate merchant objectives into a feasible architecture on Shopify (native first), quantify trade-offs, and secure stakeholder alignment across merchant, partner, and internal teams.

---

## Key Responsibilities Across Merchant Lifecycle

### Early Evaluation
- Qualify technical fit
- Surface constraints
- Advise on best-practice patterns
- Shape RFPs

### Solution Design
- Lead technical discovery
- Map requirements
- Propose architectures
- Produce solution materials
- Validate feasibility with product/engineering as needed

### Proof and Validation
- Demos and targeted demonstrations
- Prototypes/POCs for feasibility
- Reference architectures
- Security/compliance guidance
- Integration strategy
- TCO/ROI framing

### Commit/Contracting
- Finalize solution assumptions
- Document dependencies
- Define acceptance criteria
- Prepare handoff artifacts for delivery

### Implementation Advisory
- **Limited, milestone-based advisory** to keep implementation aligned with the sold solution
- Not day-to-day implementation management
- Platform validation and unblocking
- **Tracked via Salesforce Launch Cases** (RecordType = "Launch")

### Launch Readiness
- Participate in go-live checks
- Focus on platform fit and non-functional readiness
- Validate performance, scale, support pathways
- **Complete launch readiness checklist** before go-live approval

### Post-Launch Exit
- Hand off ongoing ownership to CSM (adoption/expansion)
- Support handles incidents
- **SE exits launch + 0-2 weeks** after go-live validation
- **SE re-engages only for net-new scope**

---

## Post-Sales Deep Dive: Launch Case Management

### What is a Launch Case?

**Salesforce Object:** Case (RecordType = "Launch")

**Purpose:** Track SE post-sales implementation advisory from contract signing through go-live and CSM handoff

**Key Distinction:**
- **Opportunity** = Pre-sales work (discovery ‚Üí contract)
- **Launch Case** = Post-sales work (implementation ‚Üí go-live ‚Üí exit)

### Launch Case Lifecycle

**Typical Statuses:**
1. **Awaiting Handover** - Case created but not yet assigned to SE
2. **Explore** - Initial discovery and scoping phase, implementation planning
3. **Build** - Implementation in progress, SE available for platform questions
4. **Test** - Solution built, UAT in progress, launch prep starting
5. **Launch** - Go-live imminent or recently completed, SE providing launch support
6. **On Hold** - Implementation paused temporarily, waiting on merchant
7. **Closed** - Launch complete, CSM handoff done, SE exited

**Duration:** 4-12 weeks from kickoff to closure (varies by complexity)

### SE Advisory During Implementation

**SE Role:** Consultative platform advisor - NOT project manager or implementation owner

**Partner/Agency Owns:**
- Implementation plan and timeline
- Migration execution
- Theme/app development
- Project management
- Launch readiness validation

**SE Provides:**
- Platform guidance when consulted
- Answers to Shopify-specific questions
- Architectural advisory (when asked)
- Escalation to Shopify support if needed

**SE Does NOT:**
- Define implementation milestones
- Own project timeline
- Validate completion of tasks
- Execute hands-on configuration
- Manage partner/merchant work

**Typical SE Involvement:**
- Kickoff call: Review pre-sales context with partner
- Ad-hoc consultations: Answer platform questions as they arise
- Launch day: Available for platform questions/escalations

**See:** [`launch-case-management.md`](../core/launch-case-management.md)

### Launch Day Support

**SE Role:** Available for platform questions if partner/merchant needs assistance

**SE Availability:**
- Available during business hours on launch day (if scheduled)
- Answer platform-specific questions
- Escalate to Shopify Plus support if needed

**SE Does NOT:**
- ‚ùå Execute DNS cutover or store configuration
- ‚ùå Validate launch readiness (partner's responsibility)
- ‚ùå Troubleshoot merchant/partner code
- ‚ùå Manage launch logistics
- ‚ùå "Monitor" the launch - only reactive support

### CSM Handoff Process

**Timing:** Launch + 0-2 weeks

**Handoff Trigger:** 
- Launch complete and stable
- Post-launch issues resolved or documented
- No critical blockers

**Handoff Deliverables:**
- Handoff document created (`merchants/[Merchant]/raw-files/handoff-docs/csm-handoff.md`)
- Knowledge transfer session with CSM
- Context on solution architecture and key decisions
- Outstanding issues or future scope documented

**After Handoff:**
- Case status ‚Üí Closed
- CSM owns ongoing merchant relationship
- SE exits (no ongoing advisory)

**SE Re-Engagement:**
- Only for net-new scope (new products, major features)
- Requires new Opportunity ‚Üí new Launch Case

### SE Role Boundaries in Post-Sales

#### ‚úÖ SE DOES (Consultative)
- Answer platform questions when asked
- Provide guidance on Shopify best practices
- Escalate platform issues to Shopify support
- Review architecture if consulted

#### ‚ùå SE DOES NOT (Execution)
- Build themes, apps, or integrations
- Configure store settings hands-on
- Own implementation timeline or milestones
- Validate launch readiness
- Manage project or partner work
- Troubleshoot partner/merchant code
- Perform hands-on migration or testing

**Remember:** SE = Answer questions, NOT own implementation

### Post-Sales Folder Structure

**Merchant folders support BOTH pre-sales and post-sales work:**

```
merchants/[Merchant]/
  pre-sales/                   # Opportunity work
    briefing-document.md
    discovery-assessment.md
    technical-assessment.md
  post-sales/                  # Launch Case work
    launch-plan.md             # Milestone tracking integrated
    launch-readiness-checklist.md
  raw-files/                   # SHARED context (continuity)
    config.md                  # Contains BOTH Opp AND Case details
    documents/
    emails/
    meeting-notes/
    case-notes/                # Launch Case specific notes
    handoff-docs/              # CSM handoff materials
```

**Context Continuity:** raw-files/ shared between pre-sales and post-sales ensures seamless context from discovery through launch

## This Definition Shapes the Framework

This role definition directly impacts:

1. **Templates** - Post-sales templates focus on advisory role, not execution
2. **Workflows** - Clear partner involvement and SE exit points
3. **Documentation** - Handoff-focused, not ongoing tracking
4. **MCP Usage** - Front-loaded research, validation during advisory
5. **Time Allocation** - Intensity in pre-sales, lighter touch during implementation

---

**Remember:** You're the technical authority and validator, not the implementer. Design ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Hand Off ‚Üí Exit.
