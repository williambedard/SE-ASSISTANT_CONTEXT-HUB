## Role Overview

### Primary Purpose
**Own the technical win in the sales cycle:** qualify, de-risk, and design a viable Shopify solution that meets business and technical requirements so the buyer can say "yes" with confidence.

**Translation:** Translate merchant objectives into a feasible architecture on Shopify (native first), quantify trade-offs, and secure stakeholder alignment across merchant, partner, and internal teams.

### Early Evaluation
- Qualify technical fit
- Surface constraints
- Advise on best-practice patterns
- Shape RFPs

### Solution Design
- Lead technical discovery

- TCO/ROI framing

### Commit/Contracting
- Finalize solution assumptions
- Document dependencies
- Define acceptance criteria
- Prepare handoff artifacts for delivery

### Implementation Advisory
- **Limited, milestone-based advisory** to keep implementation aligned with the sold solution
- Not day-to-day implementation management

## Role Boundaries

### ‚úÖ What SEs DO

#### 1. Pre-Sales Activities
- **Technical discovery:** stakeholders, systems, requirements, constraints, data flows, risks
- **Solution design:** reference architecture, integration patterns (payments, ERP, PIM, OMS, ESP, CDP, IDP/SSO)
- **Extensibility approach:** Checkout Extensibility, Functions, Flow
- **Platform considerations:** B2B/Markets/POS, performance and scale guardrails
- **Validation:** POCs, targeted demos, feasibility spikes
- **Security/compliance:** guidance with internal security/legal teams
- **Scoping inputs:** assumptions, dependencies, NFRs, acceptance criteria, phasing/green-path recommendations
- **Commercial support:** RFP/RFI responses, SoW assumptions, success criteria, TCO/ROI rationale

#### 2. Technical Advisory During Implementation
- **Milestone-based check-ins:** validate architectural decisions
- **Platform unblocking:** answer platform questions, confirm approach within guardrails
- **Escalation routing:** connect to Product, Engineering, Support/IR for platform questions
- **Risk management:** call out deviations from sold solution, recommend course corrections

#### 3. Platform Expertise and Question Answering
- **Deep knowledge:** core platform, APIs, rate limits, identity/SSO, Checkout/Payments, Markets, POS, B2B, data models, migrations, operational considerations
- **Best practices:** native-first approach, partner/app selection, headless vs. theme trade-offs, performance budgets, integration boundaries

#### 4. Launch Support and Validation
- **Go-live checks:** platform readiness, key configurations, integration health
- **Non-functional readiness:** scale, performance expectations, monitoring/alerting, support/escalation pathways
- **Launch coordination:** coordinate with internal teams for launch watch if needed
- **Handoff completion:** ensure all handoffs are complete

#### 5. Other Key Responsibilities
- **Stakeholder alignment:** merchant business/tech, partner delivery, internal product/engineering
- **Documentation:** produce solution artifacts that partners and post-sales can execute against
- **Enablement:** brief CSM, Support, PS, and partners on solution intent

---

### ‚ùå What SEs DON'T DO

#### 1. Not Implementation Delivery
- ‚ùå No building themes, apps, integrations, or writing production code
- ‚ùå No managing sprints, running standups, performing QA/UAT execution
- ‚ùå No project management
- ‚ùå No configuring merchant stores end-to-end
- ‚ùå No running cutover plans or migrating data

#### 2. Not Post-Launch Ownership
- ‚ùå No ongoing account ownership
- ‚ùå No adoption programs or renewals/expansion motions (CSM-owned)
- ‚ùå No continuous optimization services (CRO/SEO/web performance) beyond advisory
- ‚ùå PS/partners handle services work

#### 3. Not Merchant Support
- ‚ùå No ticket queue ownership or incident management (Plus Support/IR own break/fix)
- ‚ùå No SLAs for operational support
- ‚ùå SEs may assist with context/escalation but do not own resolution

## Working with Partners/Agencies

### When Partners Get Involved
Often during **late pre-sales or immediately post-contract** to scope/build. Earlier for solution shaping if a specific SI/agency is already preferred or required for feasibility input.

### SE's Relationship with Partner During Implementation
- **Technical authority** on platform guardrails and intent of the sold solution
- **Advisory and unblocker,** not the delivery lead
- Attend architecture checkpoints
- Validate key decisions map to Shopify best practices

### What SE Hands Off to Partner
- ‚úÖ Solution Design Document and reference architecture
- ‚úÖ Integration inventory and data-flow diagrams
- ‚úÖ Systems of record and event boundaries
- ‚úÖ NFRs and acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Risk/assumptions register
- ‚úÖ Implementation options and phase plan/green-path guidance
- ‚úÖ App/partner recommendations
- ‚úÖ API/rate limit expectations
- ‚úÖ Security/SSO requirements
- ‚úÖ Launch checklist and support/escalation pathways

### What SE Still Owns While Partner Builds
- ‚úÖ Answer platform questions
- ‚úÖ Confirm Shopify-feasible patterns
- ‚úÖ Coordinate internal escalations
- ‚úÖ Validate material changes against the sold solution
- ‚úÖ Participate in milestone reviews
- ‚úÖ Launch readiness from platform POV

---

---

## Typical Engagement Timeline

### Duration of SE Involvement
**From first technical discovery through contracting and implementation advisory up to launch + 0‚Äì2 weeks**

For enterprise cycles, total calendar time can span months, but **SE intensity is highest pre-contract and around key implementation milestones.**

---

### Key SE-Active Milestones

2. **Solution proposal/architecture and RFP responses**
3. **Feasibility/POC and security/compliance reviews**
4. **SoW inputs and acceptance criteria alignment**
5. **Implementation kickoff handoff**
6. **Architecture checkpoints/milestones**
7. **Launch readiness and go/no-go support**

---

### When SE Steps Back/Exits

**After launch validation/hypercare window (0-2 weeks post-launch)** and completion of final handoffs to CSM/Support.

**SE re-engages only for:**
- Net-new scope
- Material changes to solution

‚úÖ **Shared Slack channels** and scheduled checkpoints with merchant/partner  
‚úÖ **Clear written artifacts** and decision logs to prevent drift from sold solution  
‚úÖ **Early escalation on risks** tied back to acceptance criteria and NFRs

## This Definition Shapes the Framework

This role definition directly impacts:

1. **Templates** - Post-sales templates focus on advisory role, not execution
2. **Workflows** - Clear partner involvement and SE exit points
3. **Documentation** - Handoff-focused, not ongoing tracking
4. **MCP Usage** - Front-loaded research, validation during advisory
5. **Time Allocation** - Intensity in pre-sales, lighter touch during implementation

---

**Remember:** You're the technical authority and validator, not the implementer. Design ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Hand Off ‚Üí Exit.
