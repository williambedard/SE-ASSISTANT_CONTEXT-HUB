## ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITY INSIGHTS FOR POST-SALES

### High Priority (Test Phase)
**ForeverLux** - In Test phase with no historical SE context. Recommend:
- Immediate check-in on launch timeline
- Confirm partner/merchant readiness
- Plan CSM handoff (launch likely imminent)

### Active (Build Phase - Large Scale)
**Simply Gold Star** - Largest user base:
- 18,000+ users, 600+ products
- Heavy Salesforce integration
- March 2026 launch provides adequate runway

### Technical Discovery Needed
**Vanlife Outfitters** - Technical discovery deferred:
- Post-close technical discovery was planned but may not have occurred
- 2 separate Launch Cases (Plus + B2B) - confirm approach
- Prioritize discovery session if not completed

### Partner-Led (Monitor)
**GoMacro** - Partner (Basis) leading:
- Minimal SE involvement expected
- Blue bird opportunity
- Partner continuity from sales to launch

### Competitive Win Context
**La Sportiva N.A. Inc** - Won vs Magento:
- December 2025 launch target from pre-sales
- 2 Launch Cases - may indicate multi-store approach
- Migration complexity considerations
